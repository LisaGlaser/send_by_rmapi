# send_by_rmapi
This is a calibre plugin, which I set up to send files directly to the reMarkable tablet.

It does this using the rmapi commandline interface https://github.com/juruen/rmapi so you will need that set up.

Currently it is set up to expect that rmapi is set up so that no password is needed and the folder on the tablet should already exist.
